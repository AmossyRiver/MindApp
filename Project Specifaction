Show the project/file structure for a next.js app with a postgres db for this specifaction : A mental health charity commissions you to develop an anonymous, secure, mobile-first,     progressive web application enabling users to log and review their emotional state.     By default, users should be presented with a screen where they can indicate their mental state     (for example, by selecting as smiley face) and add a comment with further information or     describing possible reasons. The app should automatically add the date, time and current     weather (e.g. clear sky, 15C), and store this information together with the user-provided data in     local storage.     Users should be able to view past entries in a list view (last entry first) to support their reflection.     They should be able to share this information as encrypted JSON data with a mental health     professional via the device's native sharing mechanism.     [Recipients will require the user's PIN (see below) to view the encrypted data in a separate viewer     app. PIN sharing and the separate viewer app are not part of this assignment.]     In order to ensure privacy of this sensitive information, all data is encrypted and stored locally,     rather than transmitted to a server. Access to the app should be secured with a PIN, which users     must set when first starting the app from their home screen. The same PIN should be used to     encrypt the data before it is stored or transmitted
